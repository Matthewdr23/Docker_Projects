# Project Plan: Automated Security Testing

## Project Overview
Develop an automated security testing pipeline that integrates Docker containers with security tools such as OWASP ZAP and Bandit. The pipeline will be used to perform automated security tests on a web application, ensuring continuous security validation in a CI/CD environment.

## Project Objectives
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitLab CI.
- Integrate automated security testing tools such as OWASP ZAP for dynamic analysis and Bandit for static analysis.
- Dockerize the security tools and the web application.
- Ensure the pipeline runs security tests on each code push or pull request.
- Generate security reports and alerts based on test results.

## Project Phases

### 1. Project Initialization
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Tasks:**
  - Define project scope and objectives.
  - Identify team members and their roles.
  - Set up project repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
  - Prepare initial project documentation.

### 2. Environment Setup
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up Docker on development machines.
  - Create a basic web application (e.g., a simple Flask app) to be tested.
  - Dockerize the web application.
  - Verify the Docker setup by running the web application in a container.

### 3. Tool Integration
- **Duration:** 3 weeks
- **Tasks:**
  - **OWASP ZAP:**
    - Dockerize OWASP ZAP.
    - Configure OWASP ZAP to perform dynamic security testing on the web application.
    - Create scripts to automate OWASP ZAP scans.
  - **Bandit:**
    - Integrate Bandit into the project repository.
    - Create a Dockerfile for Bandit.
    - Set up scripts to run Bandit scans.

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up a CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
  - Create a pipeline configuration file (e.g., Jenkinsfile, .gitlab-ci.yml).
  - Integrate Dockerized security tools into the pipeline.
  - Ensure the pipeline triggers on code pushes and pull requests.
  - Test the pipeline with sample code changes.

### 5. Security Testing and Reporting
- **Duration:** 3 weeks
- **Tasks:**
  - Configure OWASP ZAP to generate detailed security reports.
  - Configure Bandit to generate static analysis reports.
  - Create scripts to aggregate and format reports.
  - Set up notifications (e.g., email, Slack) for security alerts.
  - Test the reporting and notification system.

### 6. Documentation and Training
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Tasks:**
  - Document the setup and usage of the CI/CD pipeline.
  - Create user guides for running and interpreting security tests.
  - Conduct training sessions for team members on using the pipeline.

### 7. Testing and Validation
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Tasks:**
  - Run extensive tests on the CI/CD pipeline with various code changes.
  - Validate the accuracy and reliability of security tests.
  - Make necessary adjustments based on test results.

### 8. Deployment and Maintenance
- **Duration:** Ongoing
- **Tasks:**
  - Deploy the CI/CD pipeline to the production environment.
  - Monitor the pipeline for performance and security.
  - Regularly update security tools and scripts.
  - Conduct periodic reviews and improvements.

## Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** Project Initialization Completed
- **Milestone 2:** Environment Setup Completed
- **Milestone 3:** Tool Integration Completed
- **Milestone 4:** CI/CD Pipeline Setup Completed
- **Milestone 5:** Security Testing and Reporting Configured
- **Milestone 6:** Documentation and Training Completed

## Resources
- **Tools:** Docker, Jenkins/GitLab CI, OWASP ZAP, Bandit
- **Technologies:** Python, Flask (or another web framework), Shell scripting


## Risk Management
- **Potential Risks:**
  - Difficulty in integrating tools with the CI/CD pipeline.
  - False positives/negatives in security tests.
  - Performance impact on the pipeline due to security scans.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Conduct thorough testing during the integration phase.
  - Regularly update and fine-tune security tools.
  - Optimize the pipeline to balance performance and security.
