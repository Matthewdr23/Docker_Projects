## Introduction
This project plan outlines the steps necessary to create a Docker build of Ubuntu and harden its security. The aim is to ensure that the Docker image is robust, secure, and suitable for deployment in a production environment.

## Objectives
- Create a Docker image based on Ubuntu.
- Implement security best practices to harden the Docker image.
- Test and validate the security of the Docker image.

## Scope
The scope of this project includes setting up the development environment, creating an Ubuntu Docker image, hardening its security, and validating the security measures implemented.

## Timeline
| Phase                      | Duration  |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| Environment Setup          | 1 day     |
| Create Ubuntu Docker Image | 1 day     |
| Harden Docker Image Security| 2 days   |
| Testing and Validation     | 1 week    |

## Resources
- Development machines with Docker installed.
- Access to Docker Hub for image storage.
- Security tools such as Docker Bench for Security.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
1. **Install Docker**
    - Install Docker on the development machine.
    - Verify the installation by running a test container.
2. **Set Up Project Repository**
    - Create a version control repository (e.g., GitHub).
    - Set up the project structure in the repository.

### Phase 2: Create Ubuntu Docker Image
1. **Write Dockerfile**
    - Create a Dockerfile based on the Ubuntu image.
    - Include necessary configurations and installations.
2. **Build Docker Image**
    - Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile.
    - Tag and push the image to Docker Hub.
3. **Test Docker Image**
    - Run the container locally to ensure it works as expected.

### Phase 3: Harden Docker Image Security
1. **Minimize the Base Image**
    - Use a minimal Ubuntu base image.
    - Remove unnecessary packages and dependencies.
2. **Implement User Management**
    - Avoid running as the root user.
    - Create and use a non-root user for the container.
3. **Update and Patch**
    - Regularly update the image to include security patches.
    - Use automated tools to check for vulnerabilities.
4. **Configure Network Security**
    - Limit network access to only necessary ports.
    - Use Dockerâ€™s built-in network security features.
5. **Use Read-Only Filesystem**
    - Configure the container to use a read-only filesystem where possible.
6. **Implement Security Tools**
    - Integrate tools like Docker Bench for Security to audit the container.

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. **Functional Testing**
    - Test the container to ensure it performs its intended function.
2. **Security Testing**
    - Perform security scans using tools like Clair or Trivy.
    - Run Docker Bench for Security to check for common security issues.
3. **Penetration Testing**
    - Conduct penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Documentation**
    - Document all security measures implemented.
    - Provide usage instructions and security guidelines.

## Deliverables
- Ubuntu Docker image pushed to Docker Hub.
- Documentation of the Dockerfile and security measures.
- Test results and validation reports.
- Security audit report.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk                          | Mitigation                                    |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Security vulnerabilities       | Regularly update and patch the image, perform frequent security scans. |
| Misconfigurations             | Use automated tools to verify configurations, peer reviews. |
| Incomplete testing            | Thoroughly plan and execute testing phases, use comprehensive testing tools. |
